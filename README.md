# Meal Generator

One of the most difficult things about doing a diet is to make a meal that matches the calories needed and has the things that you like it's, or at least close to it. The purpose of this project is to create a web page that helps people create a meal for their diet given a selection of food like meat, rice, eggs and others so the user can choose what they want and it will calculate the caloric value and compare with the amount of calories that they need checking if it's going to break the diet or not.

The page is going to be divided into two sections. The first one is a form that will ask the user their weight, height, physical activity and age so it can calculate the amount of calories needed daily, then calculate the amount of calories needed to generate caloric deficits making them lose weight. The second section will be the meal generator, there is going to be two boxes one will be the food box were all the food options are going to be displayed, represented as buttons with a click event listener, and the other box is going to be the meal box were once the food is clicked from the food box is going to appear on this box and underneath is going to have a calorie calculator telling the user how many calories this meal will have. The calories of the meal are going to be compared with the result of the meal calories made in the first section, in the case that is surpassed is going to show a message warning the user that it surpasses the number of calories and suggests removing one of the ingredients. 

For propuses of this project, I decided to pick 10 food choices with the amount in grams or portions depending on the product.
