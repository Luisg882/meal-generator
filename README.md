# Meal Generator

One of the most difficult things about doing a diet is to make a meal that matches the calories needed and has the things that you like it's, or at least close to it. The purpose of this project is to create a web page that helps people create a meal for their diet given a selection of food choices like meat, rice, eggs and others so the user can choose what they want and it will calculate the caloric value and compare with the amount of calories they need checking if it's going to break the diet or not.

The page is going to be divided into two sections. The first one is a  that will ask the user their weight, height, physical activity and age so it can calculate the amount of calories needed daily, then calculate the amount of calories needed to generate caloric deficits making them lose weight and finally calculate the amount of calories per meal. The second section will be the meal generator, here there is going to be one section with the food choices, when clicked they will go to the meal section, underneath the meal section there is going to be a calorie calculator telling the user how many calories this meal will have. The calories of the meal are going to be compared with the result of the calories per meal, calculated previously, in the case that surpasses the calories per meal it's going to show a warning message to the user saying how many calories they need to take off from the selected meal.

## Features

- **Header**
    - Is the first part of the website. Shows the name of the page and the logo 

    ![image of the header section showing the name of the page, Meal generator, and the logo on the side](/assets/images/header.webp)

- **Introduction**
    - A breave introduction on how to lose weight by controlling the number of calories we take
    - The purpose of this paragraph is to provide more information on what this website is about so they will know what to expect and follow up.

- **Personal Information**
    - In this section, there is a series of inputs asking for information about weight, height, age and sex.
    - This information is used later to calculate the amount of daily calories, caloric deficit and how many calories they need per meal.
    - A submit button is going to trigger the JavaScript to make this calculation.
    - Each of the inputs will have a validation: Wight is a minimun of 10 kilograms, height a minimun of 90 centimeters and a minumun age of 7. All this values are standars for a 7 years girl

    ![image of the personal information section showing the weight, height, age, sex and the submit button](/assets/images/personal-information.webp)

- **Daily Calories**
    - In this section, we calculate the number of calories needed by following the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is 10 * weight (kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) + 5 for man and 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) - 161 for â€‹woman, with the personal information taking before.

    ![image of the daily calories after submitting the personal information, value of 1857.5](/assets/images/daily-calories.webp)

- **Caloric Deficit**
    - In this section, we calculate the caloric deficit by subtracting 20% of the daily calories.
    - This result is calculated after clicking the calculate button.
    - If the personal information doesn't past the validation an Alert message is going to appar advicing the user to modify the values and provide the minimun values, also the calculation is not going to happen.

    ![image of the caloric deficit after submitting the personal information, value of 1486](/assets/images/caloric-deficit.webp)

- **Calories per Meal**
    - In this section, we calculate the amount of calories per meal by subtracting 30% of the Caloric Deficit.
    - This result is calculated after clicking the calculate button.
    - The way that the diet is structured on this website is to have 3 meals of 30% value of the Caloric Deficit and snacks of 5%.

- **Meal Generator introduction**
    - This section provides a brief description of how it works the meal generator

    ![image of the Meal Generator introduction paragraph](/assets/images/meal-generator-introduction.webp)

- **Food Choices**
    - This section has all the food choices available, for this project, it was picked 10 food choices, 5 of them were proteins and the other 5 were carbohydrates to balance the diet.
    - When clicked they are going to appear on the Meal section.
    - This section is going to remain hidden until the user makes the calcualtion of his caloric needs.

    ![image of the food choices](/assets/images/food-selection.webp)

- **Meal Section**
    - Over here all the clicked food from the Food Choices going to be displayed.
    - Each food choice has a click event listener that removes them from the meal choice.

- **Total Meal Calories**
    - In this section, we calculate the amount of calories between all the food choices on the meal section and display it.
    - In the case the user surpasses the calories per meal an alert message is going to appear telling the user that they pass the amount of calories per meal and advise them to reduce the food choices in the meal section and how many calories they need to take from the meal.

- **Footer**
    - It has links to social media and will open in a new tab. This is made to engage the user.

love math code to add the event listeners to the food choices wen the page loads and increment score
